The core GAN model is trained to produce realistic visualizations of urban spaces,encompassing elements such as streets, buildings,
and green areas. The adversarial learning process involves two neural networks—the generator and the. discriminator—that iteratively
improve each other. The generator creates synthetic urban images, while the discriminator evaluates their realism, refining the model
until the generated visuals closely mimic realworld urban settings. This system holds potential to revolutionize urban planning by
providing stakeholders with realistic simulations that can aid in scenario analysis, design validation, and decision support.It reduces
reliance on traditional visualization methods and introduces a dynamic, data-driven framework for exploring urban development
possibilities.The project is implemented using Python, incorporating advanced machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and
PyTorch. The GAN-based simulations are seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling planners,
architects, and researchers to interact with and analyze the generated visuals in real-time. Manual testing
confirms the model's robustness and the generated images' high fidelity to real-world urban characteristics.Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have opened new avenues for
automating and enhancing this process. This study explores the use of Conditional GANs (cGANs) and CycleGANs for generating and
refining residential layouts. Specifically, it integrates cGANs for generating layout images from structured JSON documents and
CycleGANs, leveraging ResNet-based generators and PatchGAN discriminators, to transform these layouts into realistic satellite
imagery
